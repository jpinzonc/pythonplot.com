## An Introduction to Python Plotting for Exploratory Data Analysis

Available at [pythonplot.com](http://pythonplot.com/)

### Contributing

The site is generated from plots in the `Examples.ipynb` Python 3, Jupyter notebook.

You can create a [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html) dev environment to run the notebook with `make dev_environment`.

Each plot in the notebook is tagged with metadata using Jupyter cell tags. You can view the cell tags in your notebook with `View > Cell Toolbar > Tags`.

The tags look like this:

```
ex
name:scatter-with-regression
package:ggplot
```

If you are using Jupyter lab, these are available through the `Cell Tools` left sidebar menu:
```
{
    "tags": [
        "ex",
        "name:scatter-with-regression",
        "package:ggplot"
    ]
}
```

`ex` identifies the cell as an example. The `name` tag corresponds to an item in the `names` dictionary in `render.py`. The `package` tag corresponds to a package in the `packages` dict in `render.py`.

The site layout current allows for ~46 characters in the code window. Please keep this in mind and wrap your code to avoid too much side scrolling.

At the moment, the code must return a png image into the output cell. To generate image files with `plotly`, using their server is currently the only way. Please see the [getting started page](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/) for instructions on the `.credentials` file.

A Markdown comment can be added within triple quotes on the first line of the cell. (This currently doesn't work for `R` cells.)

You can render the images to `web/img/plots` by running `$ make`. Afterward, launch a local server (e.g. `python -m http.server`) from the `web` directory.
